# Plurality-Dictionary-App
This app is an unofficial port of [The Plurality Dictionary](https://system-dictionary.carrd.co/) to Android devices.
This port does not need Internet or Data to run, and will be updated (maybe). Blossom was removed from the More tab due to being deprecated.
This app does NOT replace the original website. If you prefer the website for its more friendly wording, that is fine.
This app can however grow to include most definitions, due to it not having a text element limit.
